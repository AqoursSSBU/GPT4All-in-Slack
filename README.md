# GPT4All in Slack

This is a modified version of a ChatGPT Slack app that allows the host to use a private GPT4All API instead of the OpenAI API. Theoretically, any API that is fully compatible with OpenAI API calls can be used, but the app has only been tested on GPT4All's server mode.

## How It Works

You can interact with GPT4All like you do in the UI. In the same thread, the bot remember what you already said.

Consider this realistic scenario: ask the bot to generate a business email for communication with your manager.

With GPT4All, you don't need to ask a perfectly formulated question at first. Adjusting the details after receiving the bot's initial response is a great approach.

Doesn't that sound cool? ðŸ˜Ž

## Running the App on Your Local Machine

To run this app and the GPT4All API on your local machine, you only need to follow these simple steps:

* Create a new Slack app using the manifest-dev.yml file
* Install the app into your Slack workspace
* Initiate an ngrok instance on port 4891
* Enable the web server functionality in the GPT4All UI (under the Application tab in Settings)
* Start the app

You do not need to have the ngrok instance and the Slack app on the same machine. Only the GPT4All API and ngrok instance need to be on the same machine.

```bash
# Create an ngrok instance on port 4891
ngrok http 4891
```

```bash
# Create an app-level token with connections:write scope
export SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-1-...
# Install the app into your workspace to grab this token
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
# Find URL from ngrok console
export OPENAI_API_BASE=https://...

## Running the App for Company Workspaces

Confidentiality of information is top priority for businesses.

This app is open-sourced! so please feel free to fork it and deploy the app onto the infrastructure that you manage.
After going through the above local development process, you can deploy the app using `Dockerfile`, which is placed at the root directory.

The `Dockerfile` is designed to establish a WebSocket connection with Slack via Socket Mode.
This means that there's no need to provide a public URL for communication with Slack.

## Contributions

You're always welcome to contribute! :raised_hands:
When you make changes to the code in this project, please keep these points in mind:
- When making changes to the app, please avoid anything that could cause breaking behavior. If such changes are absolutely necessary due to critical reasons, like security issues, please start a discussion in GitHub Issues before making significant alterations.
- When you have the chance, please write some unit tests. Especially when you touch internal utility modules (e.g., `app/markdown.py` etc.) and add/edit the code that do not call any web APIs, writing tests should be relatively easy.
- Before committing your changes, be sure to run `./validate.sh`. The script runs black (code formatter), flake8 and pytype (static code analyzers).
