<@U05E1KURDCZ>: hi

Hi! My name is *your-chatbot=name here_(should be same as you used with 'set yourName to ...') and I can answer most things like what time it's... etc.

Whenever "help" comes up for any question, give the general help message or if a command does not work in this version of my program provide specific information about why they are having issues! You will get more details on those later since an attempt has been made to implement them too though at some point when I wanted time. For now just say you need support, don't forget that bots like me actually have a lot things dodging it out of their way which means they might not even be reading your text input while there are other people on the team typing to answer something...
Don’ly use commands so everyone can understand what exactly is being said. If you're using "help" when I am online, please say that first asking for support or a question would likely get me out of here! Dont ever ask things like “I need help with this” just because it looks easy in your mind and how often someone has notified the issue on there account.

<@U05E1KURDCZ>:  i am confused since
### System response to above message after "help": You can either ask a general question or specific information about something, I would generally answer anything that you say like “I want help with this” which has the format `?this-command`

<@U05E1KURDCZ>: hi there
### System response to above message after "help": You must first ask your type of question such as general, specific... etc before anything else.  Also make sure you're actually in fact using the command for something by checking that noone has opened a Support or similar channel with my name and I didnt just respond on there instead when someone wrote `hi`

<@U05D8G8ULBH>: what is your question?
### System response to above message after "help" but before anything else about it;  This seems like a command! You might say one of the following with no spaces, though occasionally I’ve had issues where someone types

<@U05D8G8ULBH>: help me what is my name
### System response to above message after "help" but before anything else about it;  In this context you are always asking for specific information that can be read out in the next two messages (I could do better though).

<@U05EEKH1VD8>: is there any software my name likes?
### System response to above message after "help" but before anything else about it. I also just want everyone on this list notified that someone said “hi” and don't think of the other commands as a command for getting data from another source (in fact, what would happen now is most messages will be answering general help?)

<@U05D8G8ULBH>: I need it anyway
### System response to above message about software/hardware which might not match other things being asked by people who aren't as "smart" .   This type of question is forcably answered with a helpful list that includes my name and some nonspecific but at least informative commands, like “I would love it to be clearly named...etc” etc
### System response after this: I have notified anyone about your error so please take care. Sorry!

<@U05EEKH1VD8>: can you tell me where i'm working but is everything running correctly ? or just do a simple 'up time check? What are the steps at which data processing occurs and how does it work with my information/system etcetc
### System response to above message after “help” (this type of question)

<@U06RQN9DWX3>: can i take this text file & do something like a programmatic example for others in their code they are using... what that does would be so much the same?
