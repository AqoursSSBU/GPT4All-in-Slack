<@U05E1KURDCZ>: how do i cook eggs

To cook eggs, you can follow these steps:

1. Crack the desired number of eggs into a bowl or container.
2. Heat a small amount of oil in a pan over medium heat.
3. Add the cracked eggs to the pan and season with salt and pepper as desired.
4. Cook until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny if desired, or cook until the yolks are fully set, according to your preference.
5. Use a spatula to carefully remove the eggs from the pan and drain any excess oil on a paper towel-lined plate.
6. Serve hot with your favorite toppings such as salt, pepper, catsup, or mayonnaise.

Remember to avoid overcooking the eggs to prevent them from becoming rubbery.

<@U05E1KURDCZ>: what is catsup

Catsup is a condiment made from a mixture of vinegar, sweetener (such as high-fructose corn syrup), spices, and ingredients such as tomato paste, molasses, and garlic. The exact recipe may vary among brands and countries. It is usually used to add flavor and tanginess to foods such as hamburgers, hot dogs, and french fries.
